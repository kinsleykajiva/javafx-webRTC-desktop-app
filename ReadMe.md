javafx webrtc desktop app .

this app uses the https://github.com/devopvoid/webrtc-java     library .

I have attempted to come up with a simplified demo on how to use the webrtc lib on desktop, In this demo ,  i am using Janus WebRTC found here https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway

please also test using this https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/videoroomtest.html when you check as the demo is making references to the remote server so random people may just show uo to test as well dont be surprised .



This demo needs more updates to be perfected , please feel free to contribute to make it work more , fork or make a PR to it .




so far this demo has a demo for video room plugin for janus .
